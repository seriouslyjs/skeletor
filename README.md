# Skeletor - Ultra-Fast Directory Structure Creator

[Skeletor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@seriously/skeletor) is an incredibly fast CLI tool designed to create directory structures and files based on a configuration file in YAML format. Whether you're scaffolding new projects or organising file hierarchies, Skeletor completes the job in milliseconds.

## Key Features
- **Customisable**: Define directory structures in a `.skeletorrc` or YAML file.
- **Non-Destructive**: Existing files and directories are preserved.
- **Simple CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use commands to automatically detect your configuration or specify input files manually.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install Skeletor globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @seriously/skeletor
```

### Usage

You can use Skeletor by running the `skeletor` command in your terminal. It automatically detects the `.skeletorrc` file in your current directory or can work with a specified input YAML file.

#### Automatic detection of `.skeletorrc`

```bash
skeletor
```

#### Using a custom YAML configuration

```bash
skeletor --input structure.yaml
```

### Options

- `--input <file>`: Path to the input YAML file describing the directory structure.
- `--help`: Display help information for the Skeletor CLI.

## Configuration File Format

Skeletor uses a simple YAML format for defining directory structures. The configuration file should include a `directories` key with nested objects representing the desired folder and file structure.

Here’s an example of a `structure.yaml` (or `.skeletorrc`) configuration:

```yaml
directories:
  src:
    index.js: |
      console.log('Hello, world!');
    components:
      Header.js: |
        // Header component
      Footer.js: |
        // Footer component
  README.md: |
    # Project Title
    Description of the project.
```

This example creates a `src` directory with an `index.js` file and a `components` subdirectory containing `Header.js` and `Footer.js`. It also creates a `README.md` file at the root level.

### Non-Destructive Creation
Skeletor does not overwrite existing files or directories, ensuring the integrity of your existing projects.

## Why Choose Skeletor?

- **Speed**: Skeletor is designed for speed. It  can generate 1,000 files with content and 1,000 nested folders in approximately **257 ms**.
  (when removing all the `console.log` statements!), making it the perfect tool for rapid prototyping and project scaffolding.
- **Flexibility**: You can customise your directory structures with any content, and Skeletor adapts to your needs with ease.
- **Efficiency**: It’s the go-to tool for developers who frequently scaffold new projects or need to organise file systems in bulk.
